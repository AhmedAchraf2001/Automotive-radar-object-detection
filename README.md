## Why radar compared to cameras and lidars?
1.	The radar provides complementary information to the lidar and the camera.
2.	A radar can detect objects **regardless of weather and light conditions** (night, fog, snow, etc.), 
3.	Automobile radars display very good performance in accurately measuring:
    -	**Distance** 
    -	**Speed** 
    -	**Angle of arrival of surrounding objects**. 
4.	Radars achieve better performance for speed estimation but at **a much lower computational (and monetary) cost**.
